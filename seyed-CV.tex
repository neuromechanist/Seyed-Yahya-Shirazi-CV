% \item Developed new selection criteria for applicant screening . 
% \end{itemize}
{\bf Research focus:} Human neural and biomechanical responses to perturbation during locomotion. We use a plethora of biomedical sensors (EEG, EMG, motion capture, and force sensors) to reach to an integrative perspective about the human responses at cortical, muscular, and biomechanical levels. This project is supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \\[2pt]
{\bf Secondary Focus:} Improving the sensor design and the processing pipelines to achieve robust biological signals. Our research on 3D scanning of EEG electrodes shed light on the empirical necessity of knowing precise sensor locations. We currently study and develop sensors that concurrently record from body and environment. The processing improvements include high-performance and subject-specific pipelines for detection and rejection of artifacts.\\[2pt]
{\bf Teaching:} Solid Mechanics (Spring 2017); Dynamics (Summer 2017)

{\sl Tehran Polytechnic}, Tehran, Iran \hfill Sept. 2011 -- Feb. 2014 \\ Department of Biomedical Engineering \hfill Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant\\[2pt]
{\bf Research focus:} Postural balance biomechanics. We compared responses of transtibial amputees and healthy participants to different mechanical perturbations during standing. I designed and created a multi-directional moving platform to perturb subjects standing on top of the platform.\\[2pt]
{\bf Teaching:} Biomechaincs (Fall 2013, Spring 2013)
